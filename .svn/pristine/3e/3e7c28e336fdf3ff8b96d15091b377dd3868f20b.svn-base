		<h2>Project: The Gourmet - Food Recipe Sharing Website</h2>
		
		<h3>I. Project Vision</h3>
			<p>
				As people are becoming more and more health conscious nowadays, our objective is to encourage people cooking by themselves, and promote a healthy diet. In the recent years,
				the trend of eating out or buying takeaways is certainly rising. Our website, The Gourmet, is dedicated to help you find the perfect recipe for your favourite dish. Subsequently, we also hope to promote household cooking to foster family bonding over family meals together.
				We notice that currently there is a lack of instructional websites about how to cook good food. Evidently, some people may have good recipes that they want to share with others and learn to cook new dishes. With The Gourmet, people who like to cook can come together to share their own recipes, and possibly make a profit from them.
				What The Gourmet aims to provide:
				<ul>
					<li>Free and premium recipes.</li>
					<li>Nutritional information about the dishes, especially for health conscious people.</li>
					<li>Cooking is not necessarily consuming. We will provide an estimation of the time required   for the dishes, so that users can choose the recipe that would best suit their time.</li>
					<li>Rating and comment will be available.</li>
					<li>Personalized recommendations according to different targeted groups of users, say vegetarians, people with special diet , or people recovering from illness.</li>
				</ul>	
				All in all, our vision is to establish a vibrant food recipes sharing website, promoting healthy eating style for people from all walks of life.
